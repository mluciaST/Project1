# Project1: Mango Airlines

# Description:

This project will create an airline database using MongoDB/Mongoose from the perspective of management with all necessary permissions.
This will work in conjunction with React and CSS for a UI that will have the functionality to add, update, view, and delete flights.

Each flight will have the following:
-Flight Number
-Departure Date
-Arrival date
-Departure time
-Arrival time
-Departure airport
-Arrival airport
-Current number of passengers
-Passenger limit
